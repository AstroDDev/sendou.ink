# Sendou.ink banning policy

Sendou.ink and its staff have a responsibility to moderate the site. This document explains and motivates some principles behind how it is done.

Important thing to note is that the goal of sendou.ink's staff is to moderate how people use the site but not be a community-wide code of conduct enforcer. This is both due to lack of resources and also to avoid detrimental concentration of power within the community. We defer to external parties to handle these kind of bans and on our end handle converting them to site bans. Currently for this purpose we recognize:

- [Splatoon Competitive Community Safety](https://bsky.app/profile/splatsafety.bsky.social)
- French Code of Conduct

It is recognized that a ban from sendou.ink has notable consequences due to how many tournament organizers choose to use it to run their events. Due to that if a staff member is considering between two consequences they are instructed to choose the one with less impact on the offending player (between ban or no ban as well as ban of two different durations). This can mean that bans are in some cases of shorter duration than what a singular organization might choose to apply.

## Repeated offences

Getting banned again within a year from the last ban means the new ban will be of longer duration than for someone with no ban history getting banned from the same offense. Repeatedly getting banned will eventually result in the account being permanently banned. 

## Appeals

Ban appeals can be made directly to Sendou. Note that there can be a delay before it is being processed.

## Types of bans

### Site ban

The user can't access the site or perform any of its functionalities while logged in with your account. The ban is for the duration as is shown to the user when they log in and can't be transferred to a future time e.g. to attend a specific event.

In addition having a site ban active during Plus Server voting means that the player can't participate in the voting and won't have any Plus Server membership for the next season.

### Ban from sendou.ink hosted tournaments

The user can't play in events hosted by sendou.ink (e.g. In The Zone and Season Finale). This might particularly happen due to the user's conduct while playing in an event. Can be applied with a lower threshold than a site ban.

### Discord ban (sendou.ink Discord)

The user can't access the official sendou.ink Discord. This might or might not happen simultaneously with a site ban. Can be applied with a lower threshold than a site ban.

### Organization ban

The user can't participate in an organization's events. These bans are managed by the organizations directly so all inquiries should go directly to the organizations.
